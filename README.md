# Ghala Simulation

## Multi-Merchant Support
This system is designed to support multiple merchants, each with their own unique configuration. Merchant data is stored in MongoDB, with each merchant having a separate document containing their payment settings, authentication credentials, and other relevant information. The frontend allows merchants to log in, view, and update their payment settings independently. Backend APIs are secured and scoped to the authenticated merchant, ensuring data isolation and privacy.

## Extending for Per-Merchant Commission Rates
To support different commission rates per merchant, you would:
- Add a `commissionRate` field to the `Merchant` model in the backend (e.g., as a percentage or fixed value).
- Update order creation and payment logic to calculate commissions using the merchant's specific rate.
- Expose commission rate management in the merchant settings UI, allowing merchants (or admins) to view and update their rate.

## Scaling for 10,000+ Merchants
To scale the system for 10,000+ merchants, consider:
- **Database Optimization:** Use indexed queries on merchant IDs and payment settings. Consider sharding or partitioning in MongoDB for very large datasets.
- **API Performance:** Implement caching for frequently accessed merchant configs. Use pagination and filtering for order lists.
- **Service Architecture:** Move to a microservices architecture, separating authentication, merchant management, and payment processing into distinct services.
- **Background Processing:** Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) for payment simulations and order updates to avoid blocking API requests.
- **Monitoring & Autoscaling:** Add monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and autoscaling for backend services to handle spikes in merchant activity.
